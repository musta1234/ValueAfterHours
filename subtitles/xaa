WEBVTT Language: en so today's deep question how can I reinvent my life in four months now that four months number is not arbitrary if it is the
 beginning of September now where does four months put us September October November December that means this overhaul process we're going to talk about will finish right around New Year's so right around the
 time all of you
r friends are buying copies of James clear's book and
 getting gym memberships you
'll already be done with doing a reinvention for the
 year and
 you
'll be well into this new life not just starting now not surprisingly for a long time listeners of my show and
 viewers of my videos I'm going to use the
 Deep life stack framework to structure our discussion of how to reinvent you
r life this fall but I'm going to be specific this time and
 we're going to have particular timelines how long to spend at this layer how long it's been at that layer because I want this whole process to fit exactly within four months all right so with great trepidation I'm actually going to do a little bit of drawing while we talk here so we can actually see the
 Deep life stack that I am discussing so what I'm going to do here is bring up my drawing screen and
 we are going to draw ourselves a deep life stack and
 we're going to annotate it as we go all right so at the
 bottom of the
 stack is the
 discipline layer so I will actually write this on the
 screen with my almost calligraphy quality hand
writing wouldn't you
 say Jesse for those looks pretty good for those who are for those who are uh watching instead of just listening what you
're seeing is a master a master draftsman all right and
 let me put a nice can I see here let me put a nice box around that okay so let's start with discipline as the
 starting place so if you
're new to the
 whole concept of the
 deep life stack discipline is the
 place that we start all right so what are we going to do here here first thing I want you
 to do as part of you
r reinvented reinvention as we start down here at the
 discipline layer of the
 deep life stack I'm going to label this set up core so you
 want to get set up a place where you
 keep track of everything that's going to happen in this re invention that follows so here are the
 habits I follow here are my disciplines here are the
 systems I'm using this is going to grow but at the
 very beginning of the
 reinvention you
 set it up and
 really the
 easiest way to do this if you
 don't already have digital things in you
r life that you
 check regularly is to print out you
r current collection of all the
 things you
're committing to put it in a clear plastic sleeve a protector like you
 would put a page in to put inside a binder and
 just put it on you
r desk or the
 drawer next to you
r desk where you
 work every day so you
 have a physical artifact and
 as we add things to this list of commitments you
 will just grow this list so we want to set up that core location for everything we're about to do the
 othe
r thing we're going to do when we're down here in the
 discipline stack is three Keystone habits it's going to all right so a keystone habit is a habit that you
 do every day it should not be trivial trivial right so shouldn't it be look at my home jam every day but it also should be tractable so it shouldn't be do 90 minutes of intense exercise every day somewhere in between you
 have to put a little effort into doing it but you
 can almost certainly succeed in doing this every day even with schedules that vary with unpredictability and
 difficulty so to start this reinvention once you
 set up you
r core I want you
 to figure out three Keystone habits to put in place I'm going to say divide the
ir subject matter have one focus on you
r professional life one focus on you
r health and
 fitness and
 one be purely focused on something personal optional and
 high qualities this could be around reading or nature or meditation something that has no instrumental value Beyond just giving you
 a sense of quality or ah and
 what we're going to do here as we move through this stack I'm going to at the
 end I will show you
 how long to spend on each of the
se things all right so we're going to do the
 timing last but I'm going to go through the
 steps first all right so let's go to the
 next stage of the
 reinvention which is going to be value value so start with discipline now we're going to values so we draw oops I'll make this blue all right so let me draw the
 box here again my draftsmanship is it's like watching it's not unlike watching uh Picasso draw the
 The Peasants hand
s I think we can all and
 also it's clear for people watching I have expert control over how notability works I definitely know what I'm doing here okay let's just write all I'm trying to do here for those who are listening I'm literally just writing the
 word values and
 drawing a box around it all right I'll get better at this all right values what do we want to do here here the
 first thing is to reconnect I'm it's going to be reconnect with you
r moral intuition so you
're sort of reconnecting with what is important to you
 in you
r life but also what defines a life well lived regardless of circumstances regardless of specific accomplishments so when I say reconnect with you
r moral intuition probably the
 right way to do this is to go back and
 re-read something that you
've read before that really spoke to you
 perhaps a Viktor Frankl man search for meaning style book that really at some point you
 remember ground the
 Jew and
 thinking this is what's important in life this is uh this resonated with my moral intuition so try to find something that you
 have experience with was influential to you
 and
 go back to re-read that to reconnect with the
se moral intuitions you
 might want to watch things as well if the
re's a particular documentary or movie that really touched you
 in that deeper way go re-watch that as well so you
're reconnecting here with what is at the
 core of you
r value system once you
 have done that as part of this reinvention I'm going to write the
 word code here you
 want to write a first draft of you
r code you
 should have a personal code and
 the
 code is not just what you
 stand
 for and
 what you
 don't stand
 for but you
 should think of it as a roadmap for how you
 approach you
r life through good and
 bad bad how you
 approach you
r life during the
 hard times in a way that makes you
 proud how you
 approach you
r life during the
 good times this could be harder sometimes in a way that makes you
 proud as well so it's a road map for living that lays out here's what's important to me what I think it means to to be a good person and
 live life well live but also how you
 are going to apply that this sense of here is how I go through my life through good and
 bad that is you
r code and
 finally as this step of you
r reinvention so I want you
 to put in place some number of rituals that regularly connect you
 back to you
r moral intuition that regularly reinvigorate that connection for you
 in a visceral way way that you
 feel this could mean a lot of things depending on what you
're set up in life is if uh if you
're religious the
se rituals you
'll almost certainly be drawing from long-stand
ing religious rituals that are set up to do exactly that the
 five time a day Islamic prayer the
 daily Torah study in Judaism and
 so on if you
're not religious the
re's any othe
r number of things you
 can do that once you
 know what's in you
r moral intuition and
 once you
 have you
r code written down that will reconnect you
 with this this could be you
 know every week you
 hike to this place that gives you
 a sense of natural world ah it could be meditation it could be a particular type of volunteering you
 do on a regular basis to sort of humble you
rself and
 reconnect you
 to helping othe
r people all of this can be written down you
r codes you
r rituals you
 can connect this all to what we set up in the
 first stage that core document or folder so you
 have a place for this to go okay so now we've moved to the
 value stack as part of our reinvention remember we will get to at the
 end how long to spend on each of the
se next layer so I'm drawing anothe
r box here beautifully beautifully definitely looks the
 same as the
 othe
r we get to the
 control layer of the
 deep life stack the
 control layer is where you
 begin to organize make sense of and
 curtail the
 various obligations in you
r professional and
 personal life so that you
 have breathing room so that you
 have space to think space to enjoy what's good about you
r life freedom from the
 anxiety of overload and
 disorganization and
 freedom to actually experiment with new things from important things you
 want to add to you
r life in this the
 the
 final step that's going to follow so at some point you
 do need to get control over everything in you
r life or a lot of this othe
r work is going to be for not because you
'll be so short on time and
 overwhelmed and
 anxious that you
 won't really get to it so what I have here is three things for reinvention reinvention first I'm going to say multi-scale planning so when it comes to you
r professional life life put multi-scale planning into work get this executed this is where you
 have a quarterly or semester plan that you
 update every quarter or semester or season whatever three to four months you
 look at that plan every week and
 use it to create a weekly plan you
r weekly plan you
r Consulting you
r calendar you
're seeing what's actually on you
r plate that week and
 you
're looking the
n also at you
r seasonal semester quarterly plan for reminders of the
 bigger things you
're working on and
 you
 write out longhand
 here's my plan for the
 week ahead okay the
n you
 look at that weekly plan every day when you
 do a daily time block plan for the
 actual hours of you
r day I of course recommend my own time block planner second edition time block planner.com but you
 can use whatever you
 want but you
r time block planning you
r actual day in consultation with you
r weekly plan it's you
r time block plan every day is informed by you
r weekly plan which is written every week which is informed by you
r seasonal plan which is updated every three to four months that's multi-scale planning and
 the
re's you
 can watch I have we'll talk about it later in the
 show I think the
re's a question about it you
 can look at the
 time management video for my YouTube page at you
tube.com Cal Newport media so we won't belabor the
 details but it puts you
 in control of you
r time in you
r professional life and
 gives you
 really clear feedback on what you
r current load of work looks like how long things take how well things fit what's really killing you
 in you
r schedule what's not so bad multi-scale planning gives you
 all of that it will give you
 all that information I'm going to say and
 I'm going to call this household planning and
 I'll put that in quotation marks not everyone lives in a house but what I mean by household planning is getting some sort of basic system in place for you
r work outside of work I have to I when I use household and
 quotation marks I'm thinking you
 know I got to clean the
 gutters we got to fix this hole that just got knocked into the
 drywall we have a problem with electricity got to mow the
 yard whatever the
se are right and
 in you
r my car needs to be the
 oil needs to be changed I need to go pick up a new parking pass for my neighborhood all the
 stuff that's non-work related but related to life outside of work we want some control over that as well now you
 don't need something as Extreme as full multi-scale planning but you
 should probably have full capture for you
r work outside of work someplace where everything gets written down I would the
n suggest reviewing that capture system when you
 do you
r weekly plan for work and
 the
 weekly plan can now you
 can add to it a section for home okay let me look at the
 week ahead let me look at all the
 things I've captured for non-professional tasks what am I going to do this week and
 when things need to go on you
r calendar put the
m on you
r calendar okay I got to take the
 car to get the
 admissions inspection let me this is the
 right time to do it's going to be Thursday let me move this meeting and
 put that the
re I'll put that on my calendar and
 let me protect Saturday put a note like I gotta mow the
 yard and
 do some housework and
 let me get a big list of that so you
're building a plan for the
 week that allows you
 to make some progress on the
 household things and
 you
 have this full capture system so if you
 jot down household task when you
 shut down you
r work at the
 end of the
 day you
 can put the
m in that system and
 trust it I'm not going to forget the
 mow the
 yard I'm not going to forget that I have to hand
 in this new medical paperwork to my kids school so full capture review when you
 do you
r weekly plan for work at a household component to that weekly plan now you
're in some control of that work as well it's not Hazard it's not just organized and
 you
're learning what's on you
r plate and
 how long it's taken the
 final thing I'm going to suggest here for this control step of our reinvas re innovation reinvention re-innovation reinvention is using this information you
 learned about both you
r professional life and
 personal life to automate and
 curtail so one of the
 big advantages of having the
se systems and
 this is crucial one of the
 big advantage of having the
se organizational systems is not that you
r goal is to try to fit more work into you
r life this is the
 common Barb made at this type of thinking of the
 only reason why you
'd want to do multi-scale plenty is so that you
 can work more and
 you
 probably watch a lot of hustle culture YouTube videos ah but that's not why we do this we do this because we want information about how long things actually take control about how we spend our time and
 the
n we can use this information to make our life better not worse to make it less busy not more busy so this is why I say automate and
 curtail once you
 know here's what I'm doing each week and
 I have a fine grain control over it my work and
 non-work you
 can begin to automate so for work you
 say here's something that comes up again and
 again and
 it's taking up a lot of cognitive cycles and
 it's causing a lot of back and
 forth emails to deal with every week let me find a a way to quote unquote automate this I created a Google form everyone in my team knows the
y just fill in this information in that form by Friday it automatically goes to a Google Drive and
 I have a half hour set aside at the
 end of the
 day every Monday to gathe
r that information it's already in a useful format it takes me 15 minutes and
 I post the
 thing the
y need and
 now I've automated that work that happens regularly in a way that minimizes its footprint for you
r life outside of work the
re's also often many ways to automate once you
 see what you
're spending you
r time on you
 can say okay how do I get this off of my think of it as my ad hoc scheduling plate how do I get this work that I have to do all the
 time around my house house off of the
 list of just ad hoc rand
om things that I have to remember to do so maybe I set up a biannual visit with the
 gutter cleaning company and
 I get that all arranged so I don't have to think about it the
y just come the
y just do it that's set up okay I'm kidding myself about raking the
 leaves I never really have time to do this I can work with a land
scaping company this is just when the
y come okay here's something I always have to do uh with my car you
 know let me let me find a mechanic I like that's nearby and
 I I bring it I put on the
 calendar when the
 oil change happens now I have to think about it when I get the
re I execute the
 more things you
 can have automated by which I mean you
 do not have to remember and
 schedule on the
 Fly the
 work will just happen eithe
r actually automatically or you
 will get to regular calendar reminders when you
 know the
 process you
 know exactly what to do it is off of you
r plate of things you
 have to remember in schedule that's what I mean by automate so now you
're reducing the
 planning footprint of you
r life outside of work as well the
 othe
r word I wrote down here was curtail and
 what I mean by curtail is get rid of so now when you
 know what's going on you
 have this fine grain control over you
r time and
 you
're getting this fine-grained detailed feedback on you
r schedule you
 see the
 problems and
 you
r work life you
 realize being on this committee is killing me schedule wise it's putting all the
se little meetings that eat up the
ir the
ir uh it's 10 people being scheduled and
 it's three meetings a week and
 the
y're short but I have very little control over where the
y fall because we have to find an intersection that works for 10 people and
 it's just partitioning my days in a terrible way let's take that off our plate or if you
're at home it's like okay is this one thing I'm doing in the
 house is taking me hours and
 hours and
 stressing me out you
 know what I'm gonna quit this thing over here and
 use that money to pay someone to do this or it's this uh this involvement I have this this community group I'm a part of this is really uh killing my schedule if I just quit that one thing this is going to open up all the
 space this is going to make uh move this sports team to this sports team Saturdays are completely open now that's going to be a huge blessing so it's all about once you
 know know how things are land
ing on you
r schedule and
 the
ir impacts you
 can be incredibly high impact and
 strategic about get rid of that get rid of that and
 change this and
 get huge returns back it's much better than just getting overloaded and
 stressed out and
 rand
omly starting to quit things left and
 right so that's all what control is about I control my time so I can automate and
 curtail until my load is reasonable and
 now I have breathing room breathing room to reinvent breathing room to appreciate the
 results of reinvention all right this brings us up now to the
 layer of the
 deep life stack okay I finally figured out by the
 way how to draw thicker lines this final layer is vision this is where you
 take in the
 typical deep life process this is where you
 take specific aspects of you
r life and
 you
 overhaul the
m to be more remarkable remarkable so now you
 have this great Foundation of discipline meaning that you
 have reinvented you
r identity as someone who is capable of doing things that have a long-term reward even if the
y're hard in the
 moment you
're in touch with you
r values you
 have this Foundation that can get you
 through the
 good and
 bad it's a compass that keeps you
 aiming in the
 right direction you
 have control over you
r time so now you
 have the
 ability to aim you
rself and
 you
r energies in intentional directions and
 now you
 figure out where to aim it how to take aspects of you
r life and
 make those aspects of you
r life remarkable so what I'm going to put here I'm going to label this here plan one large so what I mean by this is during this final step of you
r four-month reinvention I want you
 to actually take an area of you
r life preferably a non-professional area of you
r life where you
're going to do a full overhaul of that towards more remarkability and
 I'll give you
 an example about this in a second but you
 take some aspect of you
r life and
 you
 do a full overhaul towards remarkability and
 the
n you
 take uh one larger areas of you
r life and
 this could be like what you
 do for a job where you
 live and
 you
 begin the
 process of an overhaul the
re this could be one of the
se longer term overhauls that could take a year or two to really think through but so you
 you
 get a small overhaul completely done and
 a big exciting overhaul actually started started all right so for example let me give you
 an example of a small overhaul let's say you
 decide my life outside of work I need more life-affirming interests or Hobbies right I want I want some aspect of my life that's unrelated to my job but I wanted to be take it to kind of a remarkable level like a real remarkable in the
 sense that people will eventually remark this about me this is something that he really does so let's say just for the
 case of a case study you
 decide I want to become a serious cinephile I like movies what if I made movies and
 appreciation movies a serious part a serious part of my life well what might that type of uh what might that type of overhaul look like well it would be a mix of concrete steps that you
 actually complete plus new habits or systems you
 put into you
r life that all lead you
 towards a vision of that part of you
r life that's more remarkable so I jotted down some ideas here so maybe say okay first thing first I want to as a concrete step I'm going to overhaul my basement the
ater good TV good sound system get a Blu-ray DVD player blackout curtains for the
 windows down the
re the
 basement window so I can have a really good movie going experience I'm going to invest some money in this and
 I'm signaling to myself I take this seriously now I'm going to add a habit or system to my daily routine as part of this overhaul so maybe I want to get into a twice a week I watch a movie schedule maybe the
re's one evening I put aside for doing that and
 one extended lunch break or maybe it's two extended lunch breaks you
 know during the
 week maybe you
're working remotely don't tell you
r boss 45 minutes an hour and
 you
're able to get through one movie during the
 the
 week and
 you
 have one evening you
've set aside and
 sort of uh agree I don't do bedtimes that night you
 have one evening a week that you
 watch a movie so this is like a new habit and
 maybe every week you
 have this habit of going to the
 library to return the
 DVDs or Blu-Rays that you
 rented and
 you
 get new ones to watch or you
 join the
 old-fashioned Netflix which still exists you
 can still get DVDs and
 Blu-ray in the
 mail through that using the
 envelopes right uh so the
re we go that's the
 system and
 the
n maybe you
 have the
 system that says when I do this twice a week movie watching I have to find three articles to read ahead of time and
 I read all three articles about the
 movie maybe like two reviews and
 one longer article so I sort of know what I'm looking at and
 in that way I am uh I'm enhancing my knowledge all right and
 the
n maybe as a concrete a second concrete step you
 say I'm gonna found an online course about film appreciation I'm gonna take that I'm going to take this online course maybe as a couple books I'm going to read right so what you
've done here in this overhaul is you
 have some concrete things to accomplish and
 the
n a new systems that you
're sort of getting into place place new regular habits you
're getting the
 place in this example when this is all done you
're going to find you
rself in a place where you
're watching movies on a regular basis in a good home the
ater you
've studied film more than you
 had before you
 have a much better foundation and
 now you
 can see you
r appreciation really growing the
n you
 might have a longer term goal okay if I keep this up for three months I'm going to join a local film club that meets at this local non-profit Arts Theater and
 I'm going to definitely go and
 have monthly meetings and
 watch movies and
 I'll have I do this for three months I'll be ready to join that that that's an example of a small overhaul when you
're done with this you
 have made this thing a much more remarkable part of you
r life and
 give this a year or two to unfold from here and
 people are going to look at you
 and
 say yeah this is one of the
 things we know about you
 you
're really in the
 movies it's a big part of you
r life you
 get a lot of satisfaction so imagine that on almost any area of you
r life that's going to be the
 small overhaul and
 the
n you
're going to think through a larger overhaul lifestyle such a career planning style approach what is my ideal lifestyle five ten years from now look like what are what is a major change I might need to make to get me closer the
re and
 You Begin scheming what would be involved and
 it might be okay I have to build a lot of new skills I'm gonna have to get promoted I'm going to have to get this side business up to this certain size of income before I'm comfortable leaving my main job this could be a longer term overhaul but you
 get that going all right so how do we time all of this how do we time all this because we have now uh quite a few different things I suggested and
 we need this all to fit into four months so I'm going to draw on the
 screen here all right this will be our four month timeline and
 I'm going to label this timeline with the
 relevant months so let's see we got September well we'll imagine we're starting this in September and
 the
n we get October starts the
 November starts the
n December starts and
 that brings us to January all right so for those who are listing I have four months written up on the
 screen all right so let's think about how long should we be spending uh on each of and
 I had to actually I dropped the
 page that had my notes so I had to go get that okay so let's start with discipline I'll use yellow here on our timeline to mark that so remember in discipline you
 set up you
r core and
 got three Keystone habits up and
 running I'm going to suggest that we just take the
 first two weeks for this I've marked the
 first two weeks on our calendar uh just for getting some Keystone habits up and
 running you
r core system up and
 running all right next comes values I'll use a different color for this so remember you
 have to reconnect with you
r moral intuition you
 have to get a code going you
 have to get a regular ritual going that reminds you
 on a regular basis about this moral intuition here we're going to put aside four weeks and
 our schedule here we're going from mid-september to mid-october all right so the
 next layer here was control I'll use a different color here now we have a multi-scale planning getting going you
r professional life some sort of household capture and
 planning system and
 a stepping back after a little while of doing this and
 doing some Automation and
 curtailing I think we need four weeks for this as well so I have mid-october through mid November marked on here all right because it's going to take a few weeks you
 might want to spend uh two weeks on the
 business one week on the
 personal life and
 the
n give you
rself a week after that of learning from the
 systems and
 starting to make some decisions and
 we're left now with the
 vision piece we're gonna do a complete small overhaul of an area of you
r life and
 plan out a larger overhaul and
 I'm going to mark on here the
 final six weeks so overhauls can take some time so we'll give ourselves six weeks so if we look at this correctly this gets us from September to January moving through all four layers of the
 deep life stack doing specific things at every layer by January if you
 do this it will be a pretty significant reinvention of you
r life especially if you
 are starting right now from a place of shallowness by which I mean a life in which you
 are somewhat unanchored you
're being pushed around by digital technology in you
r life outside of work you
're just looking at you
r phone and
 are being dragged along emotionally by whatever is being shown on social media is the
 big thing to be upset about or not or having drool inducing distraction in you
r professional life it's just email and
 zoom all day you
're generically busy don't even know what it is you
're doing the
re if you
're caught in the
 shallows of the
 digital the
 aimless digital you
 do four months go through the
 stack once in the
 way I recommend you
're going to feel a lot more freedom you
're going to feel more in control you
're going to feel more grounded in what matters to you
 you
're going to feel like not only have you
 uh overhauled part of you
r life but that you
 have the
 capabilities to keep going and
 pile remarkability upon remarkability remarkability all right so forget New Year's fall is the
 time to reinvent and
 that is my four month plan for Reinventing Your Life by the
 time we get so for you
rself well you
 you
've kind of already done this exercise before but will you
 tweak some things or well what I do is uh I start this process typically late June right so I time it to my birthday which is late in June because I I figure why not get started when this I'm in the
 middle of summer and
 it's pretty slow so I'm usually hitting the
 ground running uh by the
 school year and
 I'm hoping by October to have my overhauls all in place so I start this a little bit earlier to take advantage of how slow the
 summer is but the
 point is it's all aimed towards right around the
 fall is when I'm going to have some some big changes in place so I have a bunch of changes I'm working on right now a lot are in place a lot were done over the
 summer the
 the
 ones that are not done yet I'm hoping by October November the
y'll be locked in I mean I don't want to be thinking about this stuff in January I want to be Rock and
 rolling in January that's typically the
 way I see it for some of you
r small overhauls do you
 have do the
y just pile up on each othe
r or the
y come to completion and
 the
n you
 add a new one um so the
 way I have it written now for example so if you
're to look in my semester plan what you
're going to see is the
 way I've broken this up for the
 things I still have to do is I have immediate and
 soon so it'll be okay immediately that means the
se are things I want to get done and
 this is broken up in different areas of my life the
se are things I want to get done as soon as I can and
 so when I'm building my weekly plan each week as part of multi-scale planning I'm saying okay let me see if the
re's some of the
se I can accomplish this week or make a lot of progress on because I'm trying to get through the
se as quick as possible for some of the
se areas I have something labeled soon which is don't work on it right now but when you
're done with the
 immediate things for most of the
se areas here's a big project to think about getting going next and
 the
y tend to be the
 few things I have labeled as soon or a little bit broader a little bit more ambitious and
 so I want to get the
 immediate things done as quickly as possible and
 the
n plan some of the
se more ambitious ones so I do have right now that's the
 way I'm breaking it up is the
 final soon things I want to get done and
 the
n the
 more ambitious now actually this summer I did it two phases I had a phase of this I did when I was up in New Hampshire for the
 summer and
 the
n I have anothe
r phase I'm doing for the
 next couple of months so I sort of broke up because some things really were relevant to being back here in DC and
 so I waited for those part of my annual overhaul reinvention I waited till I was back and
 some things actually being up in New Hampshire and
 away from DC that was the
 right time to do the
m so for those I worked on the
m on the
 summer so right now this is what's left in different areas of my life uh soon combination of habits and
 one-time things to accomplish I mean immediately I should say habits and
 one-time things to accomplish and
 the
n soon uh projects to do next Once those are are done as well so for example uh overhauling the
 office the
 maker lab office in our HQ under one of the
 areas of my plan is a soon so it's like I'm not doing it right now the
re's a couple more immediate things I'm doing in that area of my life but that'll be the
 soon so in the
ory by like October I'll be pretty serious about okay let's I said my weekly plan I want to make progress on this let's get someone out let's hang the
 thing let's do whatever we're going to do so just a um just to make that kind of more concrete anothe
r place where that's useful is Fitness stuff this will often happen because you
 know September can be busy so it's sometimes I'll do something like right now here's what I'm going to do for six weeks or eight weeks just to make sure that uh I'm exercising I'm moving I'm outside I'm lifting things but as I get into the
 rhythm of the
 semester maybe six to eight weeks from now uh and
 I'm used to this the
n I'm going to upgrade and
 do a you
 know two or three months of something more intense so that's anothe
r thing you
 might the
re's a the
re's an easing into more intense efforts that can happen as well it's like let me get used to doing something new in my life on a regular basis so I think about this as being a key part of my life and
 the
n I can upgrade it later to now let me get really intense about what that thing is because often making something a regular part of you
r life that's the
 really hard step upgrading that once you
're committed to it it tends to be not as hard so that's anothe
r thing I'll do as well all right so let me give you
 the
 lay of the
 land
 for the
 the
 rest of the
 show I want to move on now and
 do some questions questions all of which will orbit more or less around this General topic of Reinventing Your Life The Deep life the
 Deep life stack anything about trying to improve major areas of you
r life to escape the
 shallows and
 get more depth I'm going to we have five questions that orbit that the
me and
 the
n in the
 final segment I want to do a cover reveal for my new book and
 tell you
 a little bit about why I made such a drastic change in how that book cover actually looks so you
 want to stay tuned for that first however I want to talk about one of the
 sponsors that makes this show possible and
 that is our friends at cozy Earth bedding so as I've mentioned on this show many times my wife and
 I are massive fans of cozy Earth's breathable temperature regulating bed sheets this is a brand
 that made Oprah's Favorite Things five times in a row we love the
m we originally got a pair for free when we were considering having cozy Earth be a sponsor and
 we liked it so much we went out and
 bought more pairs so that we wouldn't have to have time without the
 sheets while we were washing the
 main pair I will say this is probably one of the
 things high up on the
 list of things I missed when we were up in New Hampshire for the
 summer was our cozy Earth sheets the
y really really are comfortable I really do like the
m now if you
 don't agree if you
 try the
m and
 don't think you
're sleeping cooler more comfortably the
y will refund you
r purchase price plus shipping no questions asked you
 have a hundred nights to try the
m out you
're not going to return the
m however because the
y are super comfortable sheets I mean the
y're made out of viscous which is a substance removed taken from bamboo that gives the
m incredible Comfort but also is very good for not trapping Heat so for a limited time you
 can save up to 40 percent on cozy Earth that's not nothing the
se aren't cheap sheets so this 40 is critical if you
 go to cozyearth.com that cozy earth.com and

'll see with the
 40 now if you

 don't sleep cool or send the
m back for a full refund that's codethe
outh.com promo code deep questions also want to talk about our friends at Shopify Shopify the
 Commerce platform that is revolutionizing millions of businesses worldwide whethe

 only team tool you
 need to start run and
 grow you
r business without the
 struggle Shopify puts you
 in control of every sales Channel so whethe
r you
 know you
're selling really comfortable sheets or I don't know what we would sell Jesse I think I don't know what would people want to buy from us oh we had a coin idea didn't we like Ryan holiday did with you
 can buy the
 Minto Mori I actually okay so I have an idea will you
 Shopify to sell this I found a logo a slogan for our coin we're going to sell so Ryan holiday the
 the
 stoic popularizer sells a coin that says momento Moray remember death so that you
'll hold it and
 remember to sort of live each life to its fullest um I have to remember the
 Latin I learned this from Susan Casey's new book the
 underworld about deep sea diving and
 the
re's a uh a motto that means um in-depth knowledge so in the
 Deep knowledge knowledge and
 it's something like uh in I can't remember the
 word but it's a Latin phrase uh something like a biso or something cogito right it's not exactly that but I figured that's what should be on our coin in depth like so like in the
 depth in the
 Deep knowledge that'd be really cool that'd be a good coin yeah and
 the
n just uh me on the
 me on the
 coin I guess like thumbs up I'm not sure anyways if we were to sell something like that which I'm sure would be very successful we would do Shopify because this is what Shopify does if you
 have a business and
 you
 want a super professional e-commerce setup that's really easy to do you
 use Shopify you
've probably used it all the
 time you
 might not even realize it you

y have an incredibly professional e-commerce experience with you
r uh with you
r audience I mean look Shopify has the
 internet's best converting checkout so not only is it very easy to use it will help you
 convert customers or potential customers to actual buyers we're going to need that Jesse if we're going to convince people to buy our coin but I think people will if we use Shopify so sign up for a one dollar per month trial period at shopify.com Deep in mind that's all lowercase deep lower case so go to shopify.com deep to take you
r business to the
 next level today at shopify.com Deep [Music] [Music] all right well while we daydream about selling our incredibly lucrative coin I figured we'd do some questions so who do we got first Jesse all right first question it's from multi-scale planning amateur is it hard to implement multi-scale planning all at once is the
re a step-by-step plan similar to The Deep life stack for gradually implementing this system well a timely question since we talked about multi-scale planning the
 Deep dive earlier in this episode as I often do because my systems are way too complicated I have to start by critiquing our terminology here multi-scale planning is uh not a separate entity from the
 deep life or the
 Deep life stack it's actually something that you
 are likely to implement as part of the
 control layer of the
 deep life stack so it's actually a little bit recursive so we can't say use a deep life stack approach to implement multi-scale planning because actually the
 Deep life stack approach might include implementing multi-scale planning this is all to say my systems are too complicated but let's get to the
 meat of this so multi-scale planning we talked about earlier quick reminder you
 have three different time scales at which you
 plan so season week day you
 update the
 season every season you
 update the
 week every week looking at the
 season when you
 do so you
 update the
 day every day looking at the
 week when you
 do so so everything gets connected back is the
re a way to break this up to ease you
r way into this type of planning uh one way to do this I suppose is start with Daily Time block planning that's the
 hardest discipline of all this is because it's not only do you
 do it every day but it is how you
 run you
r work day so it's it's the
 biggest change you
're going to see in you
r day-to-day experience of you
r work from the
 whole multi-scale planning philosophy is going to be doing that Daily Time block planning the
re's no way to break that up you
 just need to do it now if you
 want to help convince you
rself you
rself I'm a daily time block planner I'm really giving this a try that's why you
 know I do sell that planner because it really helps people signal to the
mselves I'm doing this I spent 20 something dollars on this at least I'm going to try this for a while so if you
 need a kick you
 can look at timeblockplending.com and
 find that planner timeblockplanner.com probably or do it in a notebook or however you
 want to do it but just get going with Daily Time block planning after you
've done that for a week or two and
 you
 sort of get the
 feel of it you
're seeing the
 benefits the
n you
 can add in the
 weekly seasonal planning and
 I'm going to tell you
 though that's going to be easy because the
 time footprint of weekly seasonal planning is small it's not that hard to do weekly planning takes 30 minutes seasonal planning you
