timelines how long to spend at this
timelines how long to spend at this
layer how long it's been at that layer
layer how long it's been at that layer
because I want this whole process to fit
because I want this whole process to fit
exactly within four months
exactly within four months
all right so with great trepidation I'm
all right so with great trepidation I'm
actually going to do a little bit of
actually going to do a little bit of
drawing while we talk here
drawing while we talk here
so we can actually see the Deep life
so we can actually see the Deep life
stack that I am discussing
stack that I am discussing
so what I'm going to do here is bring up
so what I'm going to do here is bring up
my drawing screen
my drawing screen
and we are going to draw ourselves
and we are going to draw ourselves
a deep life stack and we're going to
a deep life stack and we're going to
annotate it as we go all right so at the
annotate it as we go all right so at the
bottom of the stack
bottom of the stack
is the discipline layer so I will
is the discipline layer so I will
actually write this on the screen
actually write this on the screen
with my almost calligraphy quality
with my almost calligraphy quality
handwriting wouldn't you say Jesse for
handwriting wouldn't you say Jesse for
those looks pretty good for those who
those looks pretty good for those who
are for those who are uh watching
are for those who are uh watching
instead of just listening what you're
instead of just listening what you're
seeing is a master
seeing is a master
a master draftsman all right and let me
a master draftsman all right and let me
put a nice
put a nice
can I see here let me put a nice box
can I see here let me put a nice box
around that okay so let's start with
around that okay so let's start with
discipline as the starting place
discipline as the starting place
so if you're new to the whole concept of
so if you're new to the whole concept of
the deep life stack discipline is the
the deep life stack discipline is the
place that we
place that we
start
start
start
all right so what are we going to do
all right so what are we going to do
here
here
here
first thing I want you to do as part of
first thing I want you to do as part of
your reinvented reinvention as we start
your reinvented reinvention as we start
down here at the discipline layer of the
down here at the discipline layer of the
deep life stack
deep life stack
I'm going to label this

so you want to get set up a place where
so you want to get set up a place where
you keep track of everything that's
you keep track of everything that's
going to happen in this re invention
going to happen in this re invention
that follows so here are the habits I
that follows so here are the habits I
follow here are my disciplines here are
follow here are my disciplines here are
the systems I'm using this is going to
the systems I'm using this is going to
grow but at the very beginning of the
grow but at the very beginning of the
reinvention you set it up
reinvention you set it up
and really the easiest way to do this if
and really the easiest way to do this if
you don't already have digital things in
you don't already have digital things in
your life that you check regularly is to
your life that you check regularly is to
print out your current collection of all
print out your current collection of all
the things you're committing to put it
the things you're committing to put it
in a clear plastic sleeve a protector
in a clear plastic sleeve a protector
like you would put a page in to put
like you would put a page in to put
inside a binder and just put it on your
inside a binder and just put it on your
desk or the drawer next to your desk
desk or the drawer next to your desk
where you work every day so you have a
where you work every day so you have a
physical artifact and as we add things
physical artifact and as we add things
to this list of commitments you will
to this list of commitments you will
just grow this list so we want to set up
just grow this list so we want to set up
that core location for everything we're
that core location for everything we're
about to do
about to do
the other thing we're going to do when
the other thing we're going to do when
we're down here in the discipline stack
we're down here in the discipline stack
is three Keystone habits it's going to
is three Keystone habits it's going to
all right so a keystone habit is a habit
all right so a keystone habit is a habit
that you do every day it should not be
that you do every day it should not be
trivial
trivial
trivial
right so shouldn't it be look at my home
right so shouldn't it be look at my home
jam every day but it also should be
jam every day but it also should be
tractable

intense exercise every day somewhere in
intense exercise every day somewhere in
between you have to put a little effort
between you have to put a little effort
into doing it but you can almost
into doing it but you can almost
certainly succeed in doing this every
certainly succeed in doing this every
day even with schedules that vary with
day even with schedules that vary with
unpredictability and difficulty
unpredictability and difficulty
so to start this reinvention once you
so to start this reinvention once you
set up your core I want you to figure
set up your core I want you to figure
out three Keystone habits to put in
out three Keystone habits to put in
place I'm going to say divide their
place I'm going to say divide their
subject matter have one focus on your
subject matter have one focus on your
professional life one focus on your
professional life one focus on your
health and fitness and one be purely
health and fitness and one be purely
focused on something personal optional

Beyond just giving you a sense of
Beyond just giving you a sense of

quality or ah
and what we're going to do here as we
and what we're going to do here as we
move through this stack I'm going to at
move through this stack I'm going to at
the end I will show you how long to
the end I will show you how long to
spend on each of these things
spend on each of these things
all right so we're going to do the
all right so we're going to do the
timing last but I'm going to go through
timing last but I'm going to go through
the steps first all right so let's go to
the steps first all right so let's go to
the next stage of the reinvention which
the next stage of the reinvention which
is going to be
is going to be
value
value
value
so start with discipline
so start with discipline
now we're going to values so we draw
now we're going to values so we draw
oops I'll make this blue
oops I'll make this blue
all right so let me draw the box here
all right so let me draw the box here
again my draftsmanship is it's like
again my draftsmanship is it's like
watching
watching
watching
it's not unlike watching uh Picasso draw
it's not unlike watching uh Picasso draw
the The Peasants hands
the The Peasants hands
I think we can all
I think we can all
and also it's clear for people watching
and also it's clear for people watching
I have expert control
I have expert control
over how notability works I definitely
over how notability works I definitely
know what I'm doing here okay let's just
know what I'm doing here okay let's just
write all I'm trying to do here for
write all I'm trying to do here for
those who are listening I'm literally
those who are listening I'm literally
just writing the word values and drawing
just writing the word values and drawing
a box around it all right I'll get
a box around it all right I'll get
better at this
better at this
all right values what do we want to do
all right values what do we want to do
here
here
here
the first thing is to reconnect I'm
the first thing is to reconnect I'm
it's going to be reconnect with your
it's going to be reconnect with your
moral intuition so you're sort of
moral intuition so you're sort of
reconnecting with what is important to
reconnecting with what is important to
you in your life but also what defines a
you in your life but also what defines a
life well lived regardless of
life well lived regardless of
circumstances regardless of specific
circumstances regardless of specific
accomplishments
accomplishments
accomplishments
so when I say reconnect with your moral
so when I say reconnect with your moral
intuition probably the right way to do
intuition probably the right way to do
this is to go back and re-read something
this is to go back and re-read something
that you've read before that really
that you've read before that really
spoke to you
spoke to you
perhaps a Viktor Frankl man search for
perhaps a Viktor Frankl man search for
meaning style book that really at some
meaning style book that really at some
point you remember
point you remember
ground the Jew and thinking this is
ground the Jew and thinking this is
what's important in life this is uh this
what's important in life this is uh this
resonated with my moral intuition so try
resonated with my moral intuition so try
to find something that you have
to find something that you have
experience with was influential to you
experience with was influential to you
and go back to re-read that to reconnect
and go back to re-read that to reconnect
with these moral intuitions you might
with these moral intuitions you might
want to watch things as well if there's
want to watch things as well if there's
a particular documentary or movie that
a particular documentary or movie that
really touched you in that deeper way go
really touched you in that deeper way go
re-watch that as well
re-watch that as well
so you're reconnecting here with what is
so you're reconnecting here with what is
at the core of your value system once
at the core of your value system once
you have done that as part of this
you have done that as part of this
reinvention I'm going to write the word
reinvention I'm going to write the word
code here you want to write a first
code here you want to write a first
draft of your code you should have a
draft of your code you should have a
personal code
personal code
and the code is not just what you stand
and the code is not just what you stand
for and what you don't stand for but you
for and what you don't stand for but you
should think of it as a roadmap for how
should think of it as a roadmap for how
you approach your life through good and
you approach your life through good and
bad
bad
bad
how you approach your life during the
how you approach your life during the
hard times in a way that makes you proud
hard times in a way that makes you proud
how you approach your life during the
how you approach your life during the
good times
good times
this could be harder sometimes
this could be harder sometimes
in a way that makes you proud as well so
in a way that makes you proud as well so
it's a road map for living that lays out
it's a road map for living that lays out
here's what's important to me what I
here's what's important to me what I
think it means to to be a good person
think it means to to be a good person
and live life well live but also how you
and live life well live but also how you
are going to apply that this sense of
are going to apply that this sense of
here is how I go through my life through
here is how I go through my life through
good and bad that is your code and
good and bad that is your code and
finally as this step of your reinvention
finally as this step of your reinvention
so I want you to put in place
so I want you to put in place
some number of rituals that regularly
some number of rituals that regularly
connect you back to your moral intuition
connect you back to your moral intuition
that regularly reinvigorate that
that regularly reinvigorate that
connection for you in a visceral way way
connection for you in a visceral way way
that you feel
that you feel
this could mean a lot of things
this could mean a lot of things
depending on what you're set up in life
depending on what you're set up in life
is if uh if you're religious these
is if uh if you're religious these
rituals you'll almost certainly be

other number of things you can do that
once you know what's in your moral
once you know what's in your moral
intuition and once you have your code
intuition and once you have your code
written down that will reconnect you
written down that will reconnect you
with this this could be you know every
with this this could be you know every
week you hike to this place that gives
week you hike to this place that gives
you a sense of natural world ah it could
you a sense of natural world ah it could
be meditation it could be a particular
be meditation it could be a particular
type of volunteering you do on a regular
type of volunteering you do on a regular
basis to sort of humble yourself and
basis to sort of humble yourself and
reconnect you to helping other people
reconnect you to helping other people
all of this can be written down your
all of this can be written down your
codes your rituals you can connect this
codes your rituals you can connect this
all to what we set up in the first stage
all to what we set up in the first stage
that core document or folder so you have
that core document or folder so you have
a place for this to go
a place for this to go
okay so now we've moved to the value
okay so now we've moved to the value
stack as part of our reinvention
stack as part of our reinvention
remember we will get to at the end how
remember we will get to at the end how
long to spend on each of these
long to spend on each of these
next layer
next layer
so I'm drawing another box here
so I'm drawing another box here
beautifully
beautifully
beautifully
definitely looks the same as the other
definitely looks the same as the other
boxes
we get to the control layer
we get to the control layer
of the deep life stack
of the deep life stack
the control layer is where you begin to
the control layer is where you begin to
organize make sense of and curtail
organize make sense of and curtail
the various obligations in your
the various obligations in your
professional and personal life so that
professional and personal life so that

is using this information you learned
is using this information you learned
about both your professional life and
about both your professional life and
personal life
personal life
to automate and curtail
to automate and curtail
so one of the big advantages of having
so one of the big advantages of having
these systems and this is crucial
these systems and this is crucial
one of the big advantage of having these
one of the big advantage of having these
organizational systems is not that your
organizational systems is not that your
goal is to try to fit more work into
goal is to try to fit more work into
your life this is the common Barb made
your life this is the common Barb made
at this type of thinking of the only
at this type of thinking of the only
reason why you'd want to do multi-scale
reason why you'd want to do multi-scale
plenty is so that you can work more and
plenty is so that you can work more and
you probably watch a lot of hustle
you probably watch a lot of hustle
culture YouTube videos ah
culture YouTube videos ah
but that's not why we do this
but that's not why we do this
we do this because we want information
we do this because we want information
about how long things actually take
about how long things actually take
control about how we spend our time and
control about how we spend our time and
then we can use this information to make
then we can use this information to make
our life better not worse to make it
our life better not worse to make it
less busy not more busy so this is why I
less busy not more busy so this is why I
say automate and curtail once you know
say automate and curtail once you know
here's what I'm doing each week and I
here's what I'm doing each week and I
have a fine grain control over it my
have a fine grain control over it my
work and non-work you can begin to
work and non-work you can begin to
automate so for work you say here's
automate so for work you say here's
something that comes up again and again
something that comes up again and again
and it's taking up a lot of cognitive
and it's taking up a lot of cognitive
cycles and it's causing a lot of back
cycles and it's causing a lot of back
and forth emails to deal with every week
and forth emails to deal with every week
let me find a a way to quote unquote
let me find a a way to quote unquote
automate this I created a Google form
automate this I created a Google form
everyone in my team knows they just fill
everyone in my team knows they just fill
in this information in that form by
in this information in that form by
Friday it automatically goes to a Google
Friday it automatically goes to a Google
Drive and I have a half hour set aside
Drive and I have a half hour set aside
at the end of the day every Monday to
at the end of the day every Monday to
gather that information it's already in
gather that information it's already in
a useful format it takes me 15 minutes
a useful format it takes me 15 minutes
and I post the thing they need
and I post the thing they need

and now I've automated that work that
happens regularly in a way that

for your life outside of work there's
for your life outside of work there's
also often many ways to automate once

The Deep life stack for gradually
The Deep life stack for gradually
implementing this system well a timely

question since we talked about
question since we talked about
multi-scale planning the Deep dive
multi-scale planning the Deep dive
earlier in this episode as I often do
earlier in this episode as I often do
because my systems are way too
because my systems are way too
complicated I have to start by
complicated I have to start by
critiquing our terminology here

multi-scale planning is uh not a
multi-scale planning is uh not a
separate entity from the deep life or

the Deep life stack it's actually
the Deep life stack it's actually
something that you are likely to
something that you are likely to
implement as part of the control layer
implement as part of the control layer
of the deep life stack
of the deep life stack
so it's actually a little bit recursive
so it's actually a little bit recursive
so we can't say use a deep life stack
so we can't say use a deep life stack
approach to implement multi-scale

stack approach might include

implementing multi-scale planning this
implementing multi-scale planning this
is all to say my systems are too
is all to say my systems are too
complicated but let's get to the meat of
complicated but let's get to the meat of
this so multi-scale planning we talked
this so multi-scale planning we talked
about earlier quick reminder you have
about earlier quick reminder you have
three different time scales at which you
three different time scales at which you
plan so season week day you update the
plan so season week day you update the
season every season you update the week
season every season you update the week
every week looking at the season when
every week looking at the season when
you do so you update the day every day
you do so you update the day every day
looking at the week when you do so so
looking at the week when you do so so
everything gets connected back

is there a way to break this up to ease
is there a way to break this up to ease
your way into this type of planning uh
your way into this type of planning uh
one way to do this
one way to do this
I suppose is start with Daily Time block
I suppose is start with Daily Time block
planning that's the hardest discipline
planning that's the hardest discipline
of all this is because it's not only do
of all this is because it's not only do
you do it every day but it is how you
you do it every day but it is how you
run your work day so it's it's the
run your work day so it's it's the
biggest change you're going to see in
biggest change you're going to see in
your day-to-day experience of your work
your day-to-day experience of your work
from the whole multi-scale planning
from the whole multi-scale planning
philosophy is going to be doing that
philosophy is going to be doing that
Daily Time block planning
Daily Time block planning
there's no way to break that up you just
there's no way to break that up you just
need to do it
need to do it
now if you want to help convince

I'm a daily time block planner I'm
I'm a daily time block planner I'm
really giving this a try that's why you
really giving this a try that's why you
know I do sell that planner because it
know I do sell that planner because it
really helps people signal to themselves
really helps people signal to themselves
I'm doing this I spent 20 something
I'm doing this I spent 20 something
dollars on this at least I'm going to
dollars on this at least I'm going to
try this for a while so if you need a

in a notebook or however you want to do
in a notebook or however you want to do
it but just get going with Daily Time
it but just get going with Daily Time
block planning after you've done that
block planning after you've done that
for a week or two and you sort of get
for a week or two and you sort of get
the feel of it you're seeing the
the feel of it you're seeing the
benefits then you can add in the weekly
benefits then you can add in the weekly
seasonal planning and I'm going to tell
seasonal planning and I'm going to tell
you though that's going to be easy
you though that's going to be easy
because the time footprint of weekly
because the time footprint of weekly
seasonal planning is small
seasonal planning is small
it's not that hard to do
it's not that hard to do
weekly planning takes 30 minutes
weekly planning takes 30 minutes
seasonal planning you're doing what
seasonal planning you're doing what
three times a year
three times a year
so it's not going to be hard to add that
so it's not going to be hard to add that
the hard part is the daily time block
the hard part is the daily time block
planning so you can either just jump
planning so you can either just jump
right in and do all three
right in and do all three
or Daily Time block plan for a week or

and you are going to as an addictive
and you are going to as an addictive
quality to it it's very hard to go back
quality to it it's very hard to go back
from time block planning once you're
from time block planning once you're
used to it because a non-time block day
used to it because a non-time block day
then feels chaotic and stressful
then feels chaotic and stressful
so it has this chemical
so it has this chemical
self-reinforcement and then once you're
self-reinforcement and then once you're
doing time block planning it feels good
doing time block planning it feels good
to have the weekly plan and once your
to have the weekly plan and once your
weekly planning has good to look at the
weekly planning has good to look at the
the seasonal plan so I would say just
the seasonal plan so I would say just
get started start with time block
get started start with time block

one night a week I'll typically go

like code formatting or do experimental

the result is that I end up more focused

wandering is allowed is this something

that fits into your deep life framework

I think it's a really good idea

that's maybe a better way of thinking
