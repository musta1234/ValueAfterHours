're doing what three times a year so it's not going to be hard to add that the
 hard part is the
 daily time block planning so you
 can eithe
r just jump right in and
 do all three or Daily Time block plan for a week or two before adding in the
 othe
r two elements but don't be don't be intimidated by multi-scale planning planning it's not something that's going to require you
 to spend hours fiddling with systems it's streamlined and
 you
 are going to as an addictive quality to it it's very hard to go back from time block planning once you
're used to it because a non-time block day the
n feels chaotic and
 stressful so it has this chemical self-reinforcement and
 the
n once you
're doing time block planning it feels good to have the
 weekly plan and
 once you
r weekly planning has good to look at the
 the
 seasonal plan so I would say just get started start with time block planning add the
 othe
r elements soon all right what do we got next James all right I'm just about to call you
 Jamie it's all good who do I have in mind Jamie that's Rogan's producer that's right is that his name yeah oh okay yeah uh next question is from Phillip I find that occasional unstructured work sessions create a sense of play that helped drive my creativity in my case one night a week I'll typically go through my code and
 make small tweaks like code formatting or do experimental work such as trying new color schemes the
 result is that I end up more focused on my deep work sessions because I know that I have separate time when my mind wand
ering is allowed is this something that fits into you
r deep life framework I think it's a really good idea does it fit into the
 deep life framework well everything kind of does right so again I guess I would place this as something you
 might experiment with in the
 control layer of you
r deep life stack because that's where you
 really put in place the
 systems that help you
 take control over what's on you
r plate and
 keep things reasonable but let's really look at this strategy because I like it I like this idea of having non-deep or non-intent sessions for you
r deep work style of work that complement the
 more intense deep work sessions so Philip is a programmer so he talks about he has programming time or he's not really writing code but just doing all the
 othe
r stuff that a programmer might fiddle with when working on code so formatting things and
 changing configurations in the
ir editors the
n yes completely separate sessions where I'm actually trying to do the
 intense cognitive thing of writing code so I don't know if I would use the
 terminology unstructured or structured maybe I would do Preparatory and
 focused that's maybe a better way of thinking about it but I think it's a really good idea because as we know the
re is a cost to cognitive context shifts and
 even within a given activity just that shift from wand
ering fiddling mode to I'm serious about what I'm doing mode can be really significant and
 we see this with a lot of work if you
're a writer this is really easy you
 can fall into internet research mode and
 it's very hard to get back into crafting sentences mode you
 can get into trying to get a formatting thing proper for the
 article you
're writing like why is this block quote not quite right and
 it's hard to get back into the
 uh that's crafting mode certainly we see this in brainstorming let's say you
're brainstorming a product or business strategy as soon as you
're looking at the
 features on the
 fancy smart whiteboard that you
're using you
 lose that threat of momentum of trying to think big thoughts that's because really hard focused thinking gets you
r entire mind oriented around this one thing you
're doing and
 you
're holding the
 relevant variables and
 information in you
r working memory and
 using those to try to move forward down the
 the
 path of critical intense cognition as soon as you
 start messing with that context and
 putting othe
r stuff into those working memory working memory variables once you
 start loading up othe
r context in you
r brain you
 lose that thread the
 proverbial man falls off of the
 high wire so I think this is a really cool idea idea and
 so we're going to make this suggestion systematic what does Philip actually suggesting here or intense deep work have unrelated sessions not touching the
 Deep work session for Preparation and
 fiddling so if you
're a programmer have a session where you
're looking at you
r code and
 formatting things and
 reminding you
rself of like where you
're going to write and
 where you
 need to write the
 new section of code if you
're a writer you
 have everything set up this is a good time to get you
r research in order you
 could have a session where you
 find okay what are all the
 Articles I'm going to need the
 cite for the
se next few paragraphs I'm going to write for this magazine article let me go get those and
 put the
m nicely into the
 system and
 pull out the
 quotes and
 the
n you
're done with that and
 you
're done with that and
 the
n later you
 sit down to write code and
 that's all you
 do later you
 sit down to write the
 paragraphs of that magazine article and
 everything's the
re and
 that's all you
 do I think that's a really good strategy when it comes to particularly intense deep work so I like that unstructured Preparatory deep life all right cool so now we got a question from James maybe that's what I saw Jesse when I called you
 Jamie it's called James on the
 next page all right next questions from James when I started college I had a clear major in mind but quickly changed to anothe
r subject that I find more interesting but but I'm constantly thinking about what else I could do more recently I'm thinking about getting into a completely different field I daydream about it frequently and
 often find the
 possibility very exciting I'm worried I'm going to fall on a pattern of forever quitting well James I can say the
re's all sorts of alarm bells that are going off right now now as I read you
r question you
 my friend are deeply Tangled into what we call the
 passion mindset all right this terminology is from my 2012 book so good the
y can't ignore you
 which was basically a book all about this issue that you
're facing right now in fact the
 motivation for that book was dealing with college students switching the
ir Majors all the
 time so we're really in the
 territory that I spent a lot of time thinking about so what is this passion mindset it's the
 mindset that says you
 should focus a lot on what the
 current thing you
're doing whethe
r it is an academic major is a student or a job as a non-student you
 should focus on what the
 current thing you
're doing offers you
 and
 you
 should be really worried is it offering me enough or is something else going to offer me even more so am I loving this major or with that major I'm going to that's that I'm really going to enjoy that more is this job really letting me is it giving me the
 things I really love to work on or would anothe
r job have a different setup where I would get even more excitement out of it even more fulfillment out of it so it's constantly thinking me me me what's being offered what could offer me more this is a very dangerous mindset especially when it comes to you
r professional life so beginning with the
 majors you
 choose and
 the
n with the
 jobs you
 choose after that and
 it's dangerous for exactly the
 reason that you
 are experiencing in you
r own life because the
 answer to what is this offering me is always less than something else could be and
 so if you
're a student you
're going to start changing you
r major why did why are you
 changing you
r major because what happens is as you
 move through you
r major the
 courses get harder harder courses are less fun and
 the
n you
r mind says this must not be in my passionless switch and
 guess what the
 new major is going to get hard too and
 you
 say well this is not really my passion but maybe this one is same thing will happen in you
r job I'm not I don't really love this and
 I'm spending a lot of time doing this which is not my favorite I really want to have more autonomy I'm going to quit let me try this one well this is not quite it yet eithe
r but that job that job is going to be the
 key it's constant anxiety that you
 are not doing the
 right thing which leads to constant quitting and
 shifting which has all sorts of negative consequences what you
 need to do instead James is lifestyle Centric career planning we talk about this all the
 time but you
 fix a Clear Vision of what you
 want you
r life to be like five or ten years from now this is a vision that captures all aspects of you
r life and
 it is visceral what does it feel like where are you
 what do you
 see what do you
 hear what's the
 rhythm of you
r day-to-day life it's not just work but what's happening in you
r life outside of work what when you
 see in a magazine or a documentary or a book has resonated with you
 you
 oh I want that in my life I want that in my life you
 want this really Clear Vision of the
 aspects of you
r ideal lifestyle five to ten years from now and
 the
n you
 work backwards from that and
 say how do I move my life in that direction when you
're doing lifestyle-centric career planning you
're freed from the
 pressure of all that matters is what I choose to do professionally that is the
 sole Arbiter of how happy I feel how fulfilled I feel in my life you
r work instead becomes instrumental it's one of the
 levers you
 have to pull to move you
rself closer to you
r ideal lifestyle and
 once you
 start seeing you
r major and
 the
n the
 work that you
r major enables through this lens you
 become less worried about is this the
 right thing for me because what is the
 right thing for you
 now it is something I can leverage to get closer to my ideal lifestyle not is it perfect not is it my passion so now you
 can apply the
 alternative to the
 passion mindset to you
r work which is what in my book I call the
 Craftsman mindset mindset so if the
 passion mindset says what does this job offer me the
 crafts and
 mindset says instead what can I offer this job and
 it turns you
r focus towards how do I get better how do I get more invaluable how do I make myself indispensable how do I build up what I call in my book career Capital the
 metaphorical substance you
 acquire is you
 become better and
 better at things that are rare and
 valuable because that is you
r leverage to shape you
r life that is you
r leverage to shape you
r work towards the
 things that resonate in a way from things that don't that's the
 thing that allows you
 to shape you
r work towards what's going to get you
 closer to you
r ideal lifestyle what can I offer my job what can I offer my professors in my classes how can I stand
 out how can I be the
 best in this class that is the
 route the
 building of fulfilling life now it's really hard right because you
 have to put you
r head down and
 do really good work and
 build up career Capital the
n have the
 courage to leverage that capital and
 not just follow the
 expected path that that career path has you
 have to have Clarity and
 vision about what you
 want you
r life to be like but it frees you
 from the
 high stakes decision of one choice what I do for my major what I do for my work it frees you
 from that one choice somehow being all important once you
 have a vision for you
r ideal lifestyle the
re are any number any number of different professional paths you
 could use as the
 foundation for building you
rself closer to that goal the
 choice doesn't matter that much what happens is what you
 do once you
 actually have that work now one thing I might suggest if this is troublesome to you
 right because you
're you
ng when you
're you
ng you
 haven't lived that long hasn't dealt yet so every year feels like a big portion of you
r life if you
're having a hard time with this idea of I just took this major this major is going to this job it's going to take me a couple years to build up some career Capital here if that feels stultifying to you
 you
 can be focusing during this period of heads down Craftsman mindset in you
r job job you
 can be putting a lot of attention to the
 othe
r parts of you
r life as well and
 turning those towards the
 remarkable you
 know maybe you
're you
're hiking all of the
 high peaks in the
 White Mountains or you
're training for some sort of athletic event or you
 get really into movies or uh building up some sort of community center you
 can find othe
r aspects of you
r life that you
 can push towards the
 remarkable much quicker while going through that slow I'm 23 and
 just building up my reputation and
 skills phase of you
r professional life but the
 key here is to be working backwards from a vision and
 applying a Craftsman mindset to get you
rself forward towards that goal and
 you
 gotta escape this passion mindset the
 grass will always seem greener but the
 thing is if you
 keep popping fences to the
 next field you
 never have time to actually enjoy the
 ground that's I actually did some events Jesse up at uh Dartmouth this summer on so good the
y can't ignore you
 so it's been a while since I've really got into that career mode but the
re's a couple events I did where that's what the
y wanted to talk about the
re's a lot of people and
 one grad student the
re had this great old copy of so good the
y can't ignore you
 where the
 cover had faded so much that you
 could barely see the
 words on it that's great I signed it I was like yeah that's it and
 he still was like look I've been using this for the
 last decade to shape my life did you
 have to read the
 book again to remember all the
 key ideas I remembered it I even did an event on one of my student books and
 those are getting pretty old now now we're talking 2005 2006. yeah I remembered though I was going to say now it could count from one of you
r uh four five books a month yeah how to win at College yeah that's going to count as one of my five books oh I can't go back reread my own books all right let's um let's do a couple more what else we got here next question is from agent three zero I graduated with an M.A about five years ago but despite some good interviews I haven't been able to land
 a job in my field now the
refore spent the
 last five years consistently underemployed since discovering the
 ideas associated with the
 Deep life I've been trying to pursue my goals in a more disciplined way focusing on methodically progress progressing and
 skill building however I feel like my mind doesn't fully trust the
 approach based on slow productivity because in the
 back of my mind I feel like it's going to come too little too late well okay I'm worried here as well because I'm seeing hints of the
 same passion mindset that we were talking about with the
 last question so I looked at the
 extended version of you
r question what I learned from it is this last five years where you
've been trying to methodically progress in skill build you
 have been pursuing those five years what you
've been methodically building towards is this idea of some sort of Ideal job that matches you
r academic training and
 you
 have this vague idea that I have this arts degree I should be you
 know in some sort of Arts job because that's why I got this degree and
 I don't want to go to waste what I'm going to say is that's not working working the
re isn't a easily accessible ideal job for you
 you
've spent five years trying to do it so the
 slow productivity approach here is not be slow in terms of trying to find work the
 slow productivity approach that's a mindset that says when you
're working on specific accomplishments be okay with that taking time make steady progress on it work at a natural pace try to make it really good but when it comes to finding a job you
 need a job now I think lifestyle Central career planning is going to help you
 here remove the
 concern about just finding a job that works because what you
 really need here is something that is going to reward career Capital if and
 when you
 build it with autonomy and
 opportunities the
re are many different jobs you
 have a master's degree so you
're just generally an educated person the
re's many different jobs you
 can likely find that will offer you
 those attributes the
y might not have any connection to the
 specific Arts topic you
 studied but the
re's something that you
 can use as a foundation towards building towards you
r ideal lifestyle so I would say right away blank slate five-year lifestyle what are all the
 aspects nail that down next figure out okay of jobs that are actually accessible to me now which is going to be the
 best foundation on which to build towards this ideal lifestyle keep it in mind it might have nothing to do with you
r degree and
 the
n you
 need to get into that job it's going to take you
 one or two years probably of heads down Craftsman mindset career Capital acquisition skill building this is where you
 put in this energy not trying to find a job not trying to make you
rself generally useful to the
 job market it's once you
 have a job once you
 actually have a job that is going to reward you
 becoming so good you
 can't ignore you
 with more autonomy and
 opportunities that's where you
 put you
r head down because you
 can very specifically be building the
 exact skills that that job will specifically you
 have evidence for reward so we got to leave the
 passion mindset of like if I just keep working on my skills and
 trying I'll find this perfect job and
 get a job and
 the
n kill that job and
 when I say kill it I mean kill it at that job do really well and
 use that as leverage to get towards an ideal lifestyle so you
 really should have a Five-Year Plan here with the
 next two years in you
r professional life are becoming undeniably great at something that you
 do not sweating what that thing is and
 again like I talked to you
 with the
 last person in the
 last question you
 can Outlet some of this deep Life Energy towards othe
r aspects of you
r life relevant to you
r vision of the
 ideal lifestyle parts of you
r life have nothing to do with you
r work focus on those as well so you
 don't feel like you
're just confining you
r world to just be being very reliable and
 good and
 learning the
 specific skills that the
 particular company needs you
 can work on the
se othe
r aspects of you
r life as well but you
 need a job you
 need a job before slow productivity matters you
 need a job before becoming so good you
 can't ignore you
 makes sense because the
re's got to be someone who's paying attention the
re's got to be someone that is looking at and
 cares about how well you
're actually doing so find a good enough job and
 start moving today towards you
r five-year all right let's do one more question Jesse I think we have time yep next question is from Anew what advice would you
 give to people with depression so the
y can realistically reach the
ir goals for a deep life well I know it's a good question I've talked to multiple people about this not on the
 show but but over email the
 first caveat of course is uh this is not my area of expertise so whatever advice I give here is not going to apply to everyone so take that take everything I'm saying with a grain of salt all right first thing first before you
 get into any specifics about the
 Deep life or how you
 want to go through a reinvention of you
r life if you
're dealing with depression symptoms you
 want professional help for it depressive symptoms are often the
 result of disordered thinking disordered thinking about you
rself and
 you
r life ruminations that happen with an intensity and
 anxious ferocity that the
y're not easily Tamed uh ruminations that have become so draining and
 anxiety producing that the
y the
y ultimately begin to Short Circuit the
 the
 circuits of you
r brain that give you
 excitement or hope or energy so that put in the
ir place a sort of severe a hedonic stupor this is really a difficult thing to deal with just on you
r own the
rapy helps you
 fix this let's start reordering you
r thinking let's start moving the
 ruminative pathways out of the
ir deep grooves so that we can begin to rebuild some of the
se othe
r circuits that allow for othe
r types of more hedonic subjective experience so you
 need professional help with that and
 you
 want to get that help that's the
 foundation for anything else all right so let's put that let's assume that you
're doing that what I've heard from othe
r people who deal with various uh mental health issues of this type is that the
 Deep life the
 way we talk about it here on this show is actually pretty useful it's actually pretty useful because the
 way we talk about the
 Deep life on the
 show is very structured and
 process based based and
 what's difficult if you
're coming from a place of depression or just from a hard time is if you
 have a definition of success if you
r definition of what you
're trying to do is based on eithe
r a really positive subjective feeling like I just want to feel great or very concrete accomplishments you
 know like I just want to be the
 best and
 win and
 get the
 best job and
 have all the
 money and
 I'm just going to feel good every time I have that accomplishment that's a really bad yardstick especially if you
're dealing with something like depression because you
're not going to feel good or you
 will sometimes but it's often out of you
r control and
 if that's the
 goal you
're looking for the
n it's just going to create more rumination well why don't I feel good and
 if you
 need very particular types of really intense professional accomplishments well that's really hard too because those are hard to get and
 actually if you
're depressed the
y can be even harder to get because it's you
 know the
 amount of just I'm willing to just do 15 hours a day becomes really difficult when you
 have anything else difficult going on in you
r mind so the
n you
're going to be self-incriminating and
 that'll make it worse the
 Deep life structure by contest it's not it's not about a specific feeling or a particular accomplishment it's about intention intention let's build up some regular discipline in our life in a tractable way once we have this regular discipline in our life let's get in touch with what really matters to us and
 have a code by which we live through good times and
 bad so even just at that layer of the
 deep life stack this already is a big deal for a lot of people who are adrift in the
 shallows and
 also dealing with mental health issues is having a code that you
 believe in that is grounded in you
r moral intuitions that says this is what we do even when times are bad and
 we can have pride in that it's incredibly powerful as opposed to why don't I just feel good all right the
n as we move up the
 stack well you
 get to something like control I just have control over what's on my plate so I don't feel disorganized and
 anxious that's useful more importantly the
 Automation and
 curtailing aspects of control allows you
 to say you
 know what this is a hard time coming and
 people I know who are dealing with depression often talk about waves you
 feel it coming on and
 the
n the
re could be an extended period that you
 the
n leave from if you
 have the
 control stack in place when you
 feel a wave coming on this is going to be a hard winter winter you
 have the
 levers to pull to pull back from things in a way that's going to make things more tractable okay I need to Cathe
rine May wintering mode here let me pull back pull this back stop doing this you
 have that control allows you
 to pull back in a systematic way very useful when you
 have up and
 down mental States and
 the
n finally get to that plan for the
 remarkable just building things in you
r life that are remarkable regardless of how you
 feel it gives you
 a sense of efficacy gives you
 a sense of autonomy and
 adds really interesting interesting self-initiated persistent sources of value into you
r life that the
mselves are like a beacon that shines bright admits the
 dark fog which is a depressive syndrome so I think all aspects of the
 deep life stack can be really useful the
 work through even if depression is an issue it'll take longer maybe than someone that's you
 know all adderalled and
 focused and
 high energy and
 whatever sure who cares take takes the
 time it takes and
 you
 have to take breaks from and
 come back to it fine do that I don't care but you
're slowly building the
se stacks and
 the
n working you
r way through the
m again and
 again I actually think it's quite compatible it's quite compatible with a systematic response to the
se all too common types of mental uh mental health issues so I know keep with it take you
r time but keep with it I think you
 are going to find it beneficial in all right so what I want to do next that's that's a good good place to end it on the
 questions in the
 final segment today I want to do a cover reveal for my new book slow productivity before we get to that though I want to talk about anothe
r sponsor that makes this show possible possible it's our friends at my body tutor I've known Adam Gilbert my body tutors founder for many years he used to be the

 all right Jesse I want to talk briefly about my upcoming book the
 title is slow productivity the
 subtitle is the
 Lost Art of accomplishment without burnout it comes out in March I wanted to talk about the
 cover I put this in my email newsletter but we haven't talked about it yet on the
 show so I'm going to load up on the
 screen for those who are watching and
 again if you
're listening go to the
 deeplife.com listen this is episode 263. I'll link to the
 video below all right so I've loaded on the
 screen here the
 cover of my new book so what you
'll see if you
're listening is this is not like the
 covers of my past books if you
 think about deep work if you
 think about a world without email the
 two othe
r books I've written about the
 world of work it's big fonts on a sort of solid color background background those are books aimed at the
 world of business like we're going to look at ways that technology has uh broken the
 world of business and
 what you
 should how should rethink business to get around the
se shortcomings this book what we see is a mountain range and
 a wooded a a Pine Forest with a path going through it leading its way up to a Cliffside cabin overlooking a Scenic Mountain Range it's a very different look have I showed you
 this yet Jesse have you
 seen this one yeah I saw because you
 mentioned it and
 the
n I went and
 checked it out yeah so what's going on here why why what this is a um it's a more aspirational a more human cover I thought I'd talk a little bit about it I see this book slow productivity as being a part of a more general movement in the
 book world right now to reimagine productivity reimagine productivity and
 move it towards what I call humanistic productivity productivity so the
re's a genre of thinking and
 books that have emerged on what I call humanistic productivity now what does humanistic productivity mean well first of all it says what do we what's the
 definition the
 general definition of productivity it's the
 the
 general arrangement of effort the
 general arrangement of you
r efforts with some intention in mind so productivity in this most General sense is I do stuff all day let me have some way of organizing the
se efforts towards some sort of intentional goal now humanistic productivity believes uh if you
 don't do any such thinking you
 don't end up someplace good you
 don't end up relaxed you
're going to be uh you
're going to be prone to two major sources of negative well-being the
 first is in the
 Professionals in the
 professional sphere reactive busyness so if you
 say I just hey man I don't do productivity you
're going to get swallowed into a Whirlpool of reactive busyness oh my God everyone is email me all the
 time and
 the
 faster I answer the
 more the
y come out and
 the
re's all the
se Zoom meetings oh my God everything is crazy you
're not relaxed you
 get supercharged busyness and
 in you
r life outside of work again if you
're like I just man I just chill you
're very prone to get swallowed in a Whirlpool a supercharged distraction and
 next thing you
 know uh you
 know you
're up to 3 A.M yelling at white supremacist on Twitter while building you
r underground bunker because of catastrophe 7 through 11 that's going to hit and
 destroy the
 Earth in the
 next three weeks so just saying I don't think about this stuff man it's going to make you
 vulnerable to so many negative things so you
 need some sort of notion of productivity here's how I arrange my efforts with some intention in mind but what humanistic productivity recognizes is that we can't leave this decision to the
 2005 version of Merlin man right we can't leave this decision to the
 people online online who spend all day trying to build the
ir hyper-optimized system so you
 can have algorithmic support for generating you
r you
 know task list optimization synced zetel cast in whatever complexity because that's just exhausting and
 it's turning humans into widget Grinders so The Sweet Spot in productivity thinking is saying how do I intentionally organize my efforts in a way that the
 entire goal is to support my Humanity the
 support a richer Fuller human life that's humanistic productivity grounding productivity thinking in the
 pursuit of a richer sustainable Fuller human life the
re's a lot of books in this genre I think we could go back I'll list a couple that I think all belong this humanistic productivity genre I think Tim Ferriss is the
 four hour work week is an early example of this genre perhaps he was coming in and
 said let's completely rethink work let's completely rethink work as this huge uh means to an end the
 end being all the
se othe
r things that make a good life good and
 if we can be very clever about how you
 set up you
r work and
 how you
 automate it let's just reduce the
 footprint and
 just make it this this uh money engine that produces just enough proverbial horsepower that you
 can study Tango in Buenos Aires I think Gregory mcewen's essentialism is anothe
r book in this category it's about how do you
 sort of intentionally and
 aggressively take stuff off you
r plate so it understand
s that at the
 core of any humanistic productivity philosophy is avoiding overload you
 have Jenny O'Dell's how to do nothing and
 Celeste hanley's do nothing I think both those books are also really in this space the
y're the
y're um you
 know Jenny is embracing a notion of uh productivity in which you
 are moving away from activity that you
 are purposely resisting a push towards activity as a way of reconnecting with values that aren't based off of action do nothing I think is a little bit more Celeste books a little bit more approachable a little bit less academic but again about reorienting a productive life away from quantity of activity quantity of accomplishments I think Oliver berkman's book four thousand
 weeks is anothe
r great example of the
 genre it's a definition of productivity that's based on being completely fine with the
 fact that you
 can't do most things so why squeeze in you
 know a few more things most things you
 can't do anyway so what's the
 point of overloading you
rself you
're still not doing those things so why not just accept that and
 and
 be happy with the
 things you
 are doing and
 the
 opportunities you
 do have slow productivity my new book is sort of in that same genre a sort of a more humanistic approach to productivity so it's slower productivity I don't want to get the
 details now we've got plenty of time for that as we get closer to the
 book and
 also I talk about it all the
 time on the
 show but the
 cover looks like the
 way it looks because this is a book about refining you
r Humanity in a world where the
 definitions of productivity that dominate in the
 world of work in particular are based on this inhuman unstoppered busyness this more is better than less it's up to you
 to decide how much work you
 do but more is better than less you
 go make the
se decisions every day and
 it's this exhausted self-recriminating sort of terrible way to organize work this is a more humanistic alternative that's why I say the
 Lost Art of accomplishment without burnout how do we do things we're proud of without having to be completely uh burnt out and
 overloaded so anyways to indicate this is not just a business book here's what's anothe
r way that Tech is uh um um corrupting the
 world of work and
 how to side steps out to avoid the
 negative impacts it's also a book about re refining you
r humanity and
 it's within that tradition and
 so I think this cover I think captures more of that field that's what I'm trying to capture here not to say the
re's no technology in this book look I'm a CS professor at a famously liberal arts humanistic University so most of my work one way or the
 othe
r is about ways Tech is having the
se impacts and
 how we refine our humanity and
 yes at the
 core of this book the
re's the
 story early on is the
 way that technology subverted the
se creaky definitions of productivity we had in office work and
 Technology blew the
m up and
 that's why everyone's burning out so the
re's Technologies at the
 core of the
 problem here but the
 solution is very human it's a book about refining what matters to you
 in you
r life and
 so I think that cover you
 know captures that more so than just slow productivity huge text on a clean background so the
re you
 go I'm excited about this one you
'll obviously hear more about it in the
 spring as we get closer but the
 cover's out the
re now it's on Amazon it's pre-orderable so I figured we would have a quick discussion Jesse my what I was deciding on with this book cover was eithe
r this cover which is uh you
 know the
 scenic view and
 the
 nice fonts the
 the
 othe
r cover I had in mind was I wonder where uh kind of like a fun vest you
 know like a 1980 stand
-up comedian like Apollo Poundstone vest and
 it would be me on the
 cover it's my arms crossed like leaning back and
 kind of giving a given a koi look giving a koi look at the
 uh at the
 camera or maybe like a saying like it's holding my chin just looking at the
 camera maybe like a quirky hat yeah the
 othe
r thing I was thinking like a a bowler hat yeah the
 the
 pipe from you
r uh French accent guy pipe I was definitely thinking like loud vest fun hat pipe in a sort of silly or like you
 know maybe you
 have my arms on my hips and
 sort of cocky my hips a little bit like so those are the
 choices so I thought it was that uh the
 third choice was me in a turtle costume costume it's slow you
 know so I was like let's be on the
 nose here so it's gonna be me in a turtle costume on all fours um holding a day planner so that was like the
 more the
 on the
 nose option so as me and
 a turtle outfit holding a day planner option three option two me and
 a loud vest and
 a funny hat and
 a pipe in a sort of a quirky position and
 the
n option one which we went with in the
 end was this sort of um aspirational humanistic natural uh natural softer color cover so you
 know it's a hard choice but hopefully we made the
 right one yeah hopefully all right well enough of that enough of that nonsense uh thanks for listening hey I should say if this is you
